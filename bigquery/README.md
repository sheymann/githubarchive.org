# Google BigQuery + Github Archive

[Google BigQuery](https://developers.google.com/bigquery/) is a web service that lets you do interactive analysis of massive datasetsâ€”up to billions of rows.

The Github Activity stream is automatically uploaded to BigQuery sevice to enable interactive analysis. Follow the [instructions to access the dataset](http://www.githubarchive.org/).

## Sample Queries

Have a clever query you would like to share? Fork the project, add it to the project under **queries/name.sql** and send a pull request!
